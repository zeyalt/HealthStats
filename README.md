# MyHealthStats

## What is MyHealthStats?

MyHealthStats is a web application that allows me to visualise levels of key indicators in my blood.

## What is the motivation?

Well, nothing is more important in life than having good health, and regular health screenings helps me keep a close watch.

There's nothing too fancy about this web app. Being a data nerd that I am, I couldn't help but believe that everything becomes clearer with visualisation. 

So, this is simply my attempt to visualise levels of key indicators in my blood and whether they are normal ranges.
